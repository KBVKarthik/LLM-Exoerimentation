# AI Text Generation and Detection Toolkit

Welcome to the AI Text Generation and Detection Toolkit repository! This toolkit consists of five different Language Model (LLM) modules designed for various tasks related to data generation, chain types, detection of AI-generated text, a reward-based engine, and a Twitter bot.

## Overview

### 1. Data Generation
The Data Generation module includes pre-trained language models for generating diverse and contextually relevant text. These models can be fine-tuned on specific datasets for your application.

### 2. Chain Types
Explore different chain types for text generation, including Markov chains, LSTM chains, and more. Select the chain type that best suits your project requirements.

### 3. Detection of AI-Generated Text
Detect and analyze AI-generated text using advanced algorithms and techniques. The detection module helps identify text generated by language models to ensure content authenticity.

### 4. LLM Reward-Based Engine
Implement a reward-based engine that evaluates and rewards the performance of language models. This module is useful for refining and improving the behavior of the models over time.

### 5. LLM Twitter Bot
Set up a Twitter bot powered by language models. The bot can generate context-aware tweets, interact with users, and showcase the capabilities of the language models in a real-world scenario.
